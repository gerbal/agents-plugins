[Coherent Gameface](https://coherent-labs.com/products/coherent-gameface/) (Cohtml) is the
HTML/CSS/JS UI engine many games embed.
The plugin ships **[gameface-devtools-mcp](mcp/README.md)**, an MCP server that lets your agent
drive any Gameface UI over a **direct Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP)** connection: evaluate
JavaScript, take screenshots, inspect and drive the DOM, capture the console, and even set JS
breakpoints.

It also ships two skills.

- The **`gameface` skill** teaches the agent the engine itself: how Gameface is, and is not, a
  browser; version-gating features against the changelog; data binding; and how to probe the
  running game for what the docs cannot promise.
- The **`gameface-driving` skill** is the operating manual for the `game_*` tools: field-verified
  procedures for finding elements, acting then verifying, surviving reloads, and debugging without
  freezing the game; the traps the tool schemas cannot tell.

> [!NOTE]
> **Generic, but developed against Cities: Skylines II.** The server makes no assumptions about a
> specific application; it works against any Gameface CDP endpoint. It is developed and verified
> against Cities: Skylines II's Gameface UI, which is the reference target.

> [!TIP]
> **Not using Claude Code or Codex CLI?** The MCP server is also published on npm as
> [`@csmodding/gameface-devtools-mcp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@csmodding/gameface-devtools-mcp)
> and works with any MCP client (Cursor, Gemini CLI, VS Code, …).
> See [`mcp/README.md`](mcp/README.md) for the tool reference and per-client install snippets.

## What it looks like in practice

Short, abridged transcripts. The skill supplies the engine knowledge; the server supplies the
hands.

### "My panel looks right in Chrome but wrong in-game"

> **You:** My settings panel is a two-column grid in Chrome, but in the game everything stacks
> into one column. Why?
>
> **Agent:** Gameface has no CSS Grid in any version, and unsupported CSS is silently ignored:
> your `display: grid` just falls back to the default, and in Gameface every element defaults to
> `display: flex` in column direction, hence the single column. I rewrote the layout with nested
> flex rows, and a `game_screenshot` of `.settings-panel` confirms the two columns now render
> in-game.

### "Escape won't close the screen, automate it anyway"

> **You:** The test flow needs to exit the settings screen before each run, but sending Escape
> does nothing. Stuck?
>
> **Agent:** Not stuck, but no key will do it: `game_key` dispatches a real `Escape` and the
> page's listeners fire, yet this game routes back-navigation through its native input system,
> which no DOM event can reach. The UI's own back button must have a JS path though. I locate it
> with `game_query`, and its handler calls an `engine.trigger` binding: the bridge the UI uses to
> talk to the game. Calling that same binding from `game_eval` closes the screen, and `game_wait`
> on the settings root disappearing confirms it. The flow now drives the binding directly, no
> keyboard involved.

### "Test the new toolbar button end to end"

> **You:** I just built the milestones toolbar button. Can you verify the whole flow in the
> running game?
>
> **Agent:** `game_click` on `[data-tooltip="Milestones"]`: Gameface accepts CDP input commands
> but never delivers them to the UI, so the click is dispatched as real bubbling DOM events,
> which your UI's handlers receive. `game_wait` until `.milestones-panel` is visible,
> `game_screenshot` to check the render, `game_console` shows no new errors. The flow works;
> screenshot attached.

### "Something throws when the trade panel opens, no idea where"

> **You:** Opening the trade panel logs `TypeError: cannot read 'income' of undefined` and I
> cannot reproduce it outside the game.
>
> **Agent:** `game_console` captures the stack, pointing at `trade-panel.js:412`.
> `game_debug_set_breakpoint` there with the condition `district == null`, then `game_click` on
> the trade button. It pauses; the UI thread is frozen while paused, so I inspect quickly:
> `game_debug_pause_state` shows `district` is undefined exactly when the row is an outside
> connection, then `game_debug_step resume`. Fix: guard the outside-connection case, which has no
> district.

## Requirements

- **A Gameface application running** with its CDP debug endpoint reachable (default
  `http://localhost:9444`). Verify with:
  ```sh
  curl http://localhost:9444/json/list
  ```
  You should get back a JSON array containing a `"type": "page"` target. Set the host/port to match
  your application if it differs (see Configuration).
- **Node 22.4+** to launch the server.
  No `npm install` is needed: the plugin launches the server from a committed, self-contained
  bundle, so it works offline and stays version-locked to the plugin.

## Install

Add the marketplace, then install the plugin (see the
[repository README](../../README.md#install) for the marketplace overview). The full tool
reference (UI tools and JS debugger tools) lives in [`mcp/README.md`](mcp/README.md).

**Claude Code:**

```
/plugin marketplace add CitiesSkylinesModding/agents-plugins
/plugin install coherent-gameface@csmodding
```

Once enabled, Claude Code autoloads the `gameface` MCP server from the plugin's
[`.mcp.json`](.mcp.json).

**Codex CLI:**

```sh
codex plugin marketplace add CitiesSkylinesModding/agents-plugins
codex plugin add coherent-gameface@csmodding
```

Once enabled, Codex autoloads the `gameface` MCP server from
[`.codex-plugin/mcp.json`](.codex-plugin/mcp.json).

Either way, run `/mcp` to confirm it connected, then the agent will use this MCP when it needs it.
You can ask it to call `game_status` (or just prompt it "check gameface is accessible") to check the
MCP is working properly.

## Configuration

The server reads these environment variables (all optional):

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GAMEFACE_HOST` | `localhost` | Host of the Gameface CDP endpoint. |
| `GAMEFACE_PORT` | `9444` | Port of the Gameface CDP endpoint. |
| `GAMEFACE_PORT_FILE` | _(unset)_ | File to read the live port from (see below). |
| `GAMEFACE_PORT_FILE_KEY` | `port` | Key holding the port when that file is JSON. |
| `GAMEFACE_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS` | `5000` | HTTP discovery / WebSocket open timeout. |
| `GAMEFACE_CALL_TIMEOUT_MS` | `15000` | Per-command reply timeout. |

**On Claude Code**, the plugin's [`.mcp.json`](.mcp.json) forwards `GAMEFACE_HOST`,
`GAMEFACE_PORT`, `GAMEFACE_PORT_FILE`, and `GAMEFACE_PORT_FILE_KEY` from your environment
(`${VAR:-default}`); the timeout variables fall back to their defaults unless the server's
environment provides them. An extra `GAMEFACE_MCP_RUNTIME` variable (default `node`) overrides the
runtime used to launch the server.

**On Codex CLI**, the plugin config passes no environment block (Codex does not interpolate
`${VAR}` placeholders, and `~/.codex/config.toml` cannot override a plugin-provided server), so the
server always starts with the defaults above. If you need non-default settings, register the
npm-published server manually with `codex mcp add` and the environment you want; it replaces the
plugin's copy under the same name (see [`mcp/README.md`](mcp/README.md)).

### Following a port chosen at launch

Games commonly take their debug port as a launch argument, decided long after your agent (and this
server with it) started, so no environment variable can name it. Two ways out, and the endpoint in
force is always reported by `game_status` as `portSource`:

- **`game_target`** switches the endpoint at runtime: `game_target` with a `port` points every other
  `game_*` tool at it and probes what answers there. `reset: true` undoes the switch, and calling it
  with no arguments just re-resolves.
- **`GAMEFACE_PORT_FILE`** points at a file your launcher writes the port to — a bare number, or a
  JSON object carrying it under `GAMEFACE_PORT_FILE_KEY`. It is re-read on every connection attempt,
  so a game relaunched on another port is followed with no action from the agent.

Precedence is `game_target` > port file > `GAMEFACE_PORT` > `9444`. A port file that is missing or
malformed is not fatal: the server falls back to the environment and reports why under `portFile`.

## Troubleshooting

- **`/mcp` shows the server failed / tools error with "Cannot reach …"**: the Gameface application
  is not running or the debug port is not reachable. Check `curl http://localhost:9444/json/list`.
  Use `game_status` for a structured diagnosis.
- **Runtime not found**: ensure `node` (22.4+) is on your `PATH`.
- **Read the MCP server logs**: Claude Code records each server's connection attempts and captured
  stderr to per-project `.jsonl` files, the fastest way to see why a launch failed (e.g., a
  `-32000 Connection closed` from a bad command/path before any `game_*` tool runs). They live under
  the Claude CLI cache, in an `mcp-logs-gameface/` folder keyed by the project path (separators
  replaced with `-`); newest `.jsonl` first, and each `Server stderr: ...` line is what the server
  printed:
  - Windows: `%LocalAppData%\claude-cli-nodejs\Cache\<project-path>\mcp-logs-gameface\`
  - macOS / Linux: `~/.cache/claude-cli-nodejs/Cache/<project-path>/mcp-logs-gameface/`
